For this brief you will conceptualise, prototype and build a digital almanac in the form of a live website. Typically used to store data related to weather, tides or astrological patterns, in this context the almanac can be described as a living, breathing, and ever evolving repository of information. Like a second brain, it will become an extension of your design research practice. 

During the concept phase we will focus on the idea of metaphor. As in Walter Benjamins concept of the ‘critical constellation’, we will take inspiration from other, non-linear forms of narrative and information classification. When organising or classifying your data, you might ask: 

Can you organise the droplets of a stream? 

Will the same cloud ever be spotted twice? 

What do we know from the rings of a tree before it’s felled?

Unpredictability, disorganisation and atomisation are sometimes needed before we can allow ourselves to connect the dots between ideas. By creating threads which might not have been spun before, we can build not only a useful hub for our research findings, but also distill our own interests and beliefs.

Think about what information is the most useful to yourself and anybody who encounters your almanac in the wild. As a MINIMUM your almanac will need to house information related to:

SHORT SUMMARY

You will be prepared with the knowledge of HTML, CSS and basic Javascript to build your almanacs. They are to be submitted as a live link, along with a PDF document outlining your concept statement, design & development process, and final outcome. 

<!— We will walk through the process of making your website live via Github together in class prior to submission. There is no prior coding knowledge needed to complete this assignment.—>
